# Underdash

The name is a play on Underscore and Lodash. I wanted to re-implement some of the functions I use frequently to: 1) understand the innerworkings of Lodash and 2) explore various aspects of Typescript (e.g. interfaces, unions, generics).

Goals:
- Simple, easy to read implementation of core functions (e.g. _.map, _.each, _.reduce)
- Unit tests
