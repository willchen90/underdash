# Underdash

The name is a play on Underscore and Lodash. 

Why I made this:

- Understand the innerworkings of Lodash
- Explore various aspects of Typescript (e.g. interfaces, unions, generics).

Goals:
- Simple implementations of core functions (e.g. _.map, _.each, _.reduce)
- Covered by unit tests (97% code coverage)
- Written in Typescript

Non-goals:
- Less performant than Lodash (prefer readability over perf.)
- Less comprehensive
